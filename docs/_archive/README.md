# Archived Documentation

**Archived on**: 2025-01-XX  
**Reason**: Documentation consolidation - code as source of truth

This folder contains documentation that has been superseded by the canonical documentation:

- **`CONFIGURATION.md`** - Complete configuration reference
- **`DEVELOPMENT.md`** - Development workflows and setup
- **`ARCHITECTURE.md`** - System architecture and design
- **`README.md`** (root) - Project overview and quick start

---

## Archived Files

### Superseded by CONFIGURATION.md
- `site-config.md` - Site configuration reference

### Superseded by DEVELOPMENT.md
- `QUICKSTART.md` - Quick start guide (merged into README.md and DEVELOPMENT.md)
- `QUICK-REFERENCE.md` - Quick reference (merged into DEVELOPMENT.md)
- `photo-processing.md` - Photo processing workflow

### Superseded by ARCHITECTURE.md
- `SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE.md` - System architecture overview
- `IMAGE-SYSTEM-README.md` - Image system architecture
- `image-*.md` files - Image optimization and component docs

### Implementation Notes (Historical)
- `HERO-*.md` files - Hero component implementation details
- `TRIP-DETAIL-REFINEMENTS.md` - Trip detail page implementation
- `OPTION-2-COMPLETE.md` - Implementation option documentation
- `download-deterrents.md` - Download deterrent implementation

### Detailed Guides (May still be useful)

- `ALBUM-LOCATIONS-GUIDE.md` - Album location setup guide (workflow now in DEVELOPMENT.md)

## Why Archived?

The documentation was consolidated to:
1. **Eliminate duplication** - Multiple docs covered the same topics
2. **Ensure accuracy** - All canonical docs are derived from actual code
3. **Simplify maintenance** - Fewer files to keep in sync
4. **Improve discoverability** - Clear structure with 3-5 canonical docs

## Can I Still Use These?

Yes, but be aware:
- Content may be outdated
- Examples may not match current codebase
- New features may not be documented

**Recommendation**: Refer to canonical docs first (`docs/CONFIGURATION.md`, `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`).
